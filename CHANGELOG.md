# Changelog

All notable changes to the Python implementation of Harnas are
recorded here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and Harnas adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) on
the specification as a whole.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-28

### Reference implementation (Python)

#### Changed

- Agent-level conformance now includes streaming fixtures; the Python
  runner replays `provider-script-stream.json` through the AgentLoop
  streaming path.
- `AgentLoop` accepts a deterministic streaming provider for fixture
  replay while preserving the buffered conformance path.
- The implementation now passes 7/7 conformance fixtures
  byte-identically with the Ruby reference.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-28

First released version of the Python implementation. It passed all five
initial buffered conformance fixtures byte-identically with the Ruby
reference, while intentionally remaining a conformance-first,
standard-library-only port rather than a full peer implementation.
